    <h1>CLJ Commons</h1>

    <p>CLJ Commons is a community-led project to build up the supporting infrastructure around Clojure to make it a
        better experience for people new to Clojure, as well as existing Clojurists.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Improve the experience for beginning Clojure users by providing a clear, coherent, path towards adopting
            Clojure
        </li>
        <li>Improve the experience of using Clojure for existing users by shaving off it’s rough edges (error messages,
            stack traces, cryptic docstrings) and providing a unified documentation repository.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a common set of tools and solutions for Clojure users to adopt to reduce duplication of work.
            “Lifting the Lisp curse”
        </li>
    </ul>
