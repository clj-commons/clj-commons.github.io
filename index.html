    <h1>CLJ Commons</h1>

    <p><a href = "https://github.com/clj-commons">CLJ Commons</a> is a community-led project to build up the supporting infrastructure around Clojure to make it a
        better experience for people new to Clojure, as well as existing Clojurists.</p>

    <h2>Current Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Adopt important Clojure libraries when the original maintainers no longer have the time or interest to keep them updated.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Improve the experience for beginning Clojure users by providing a clear, coherent, path towards adopting
            Clojure
        </li>
        <li>Improve the experience of using Clojure for existing users by shaving off its rough edges (error messages,
            stack traces, cryptic docstrings) and providing a unified documentation repository.
        </li>
        <li>Provide a common set of tools and solutions for Clojure users to adopt to reduce duplication of work.
            “Lifting the Lisp curse”
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>We have set up a <a href = "http://github.com/clj-commons/meta">meta-repository</a> where you can file issues for projects you want CLJ commons to adopt, or if you're interested in joining as a maintainer for a project that is dear to your heart.</p>
    <p>Our meta-repository <a href="https://github.com/clj-commons/meta/blob/master/README.md">README</a> discusses project entry and maintenance criteria,
        and the repo also contains our general principles of <a href="https://github.com/clj-commons/meta/blob/master/PROJECT_GOVERNANCE.md">project governance</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>You'll find a list of projects we maintain (and their current maintainers) over <a href="https://clj-commons.org/projects.html">here</a></p>
