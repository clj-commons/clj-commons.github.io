    <h1>CLJ Commons</h1>

    <p><a href = "https://github.com/clj-commons">CLJ Commons</a> is a community-led project to build up the supporting infrastructure around Clojure to make it a
        better experience for people new to Clojure, as well as existing Clojurists.</p>

    <h2>Current Goals</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Adopt important Clojure libraries when the original maintainers no longer have the time or interest to keep them updated.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p>We have set up a <a href = "http://github.com/clj-commons/meta">meta-repository</a> where you can file issues for projects you want CLJ Commons to adopt, or if you're interested in joining as a maintainer for a project that is dear to your heart.</p>
    <p>You can read more about our <a href="https://clj-commons.org/accepting-projects.html">process for accepting projects</a> and <a href="https://clj-commons.org/maintaining-projects.html">how we expect projects to be maintained</a>.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>You can see an <a href="https://clj-commons.org/projects.html">auto-generated list of projects we maintain</a> with their current maintainers.</p>
    <h2>Who's Involved?</h2>
    <p>The CLJ Commons leadership team is made up of <a href="https://github.com/slipset">Erik Assum</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danielcompton">Daniel Compton</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield">Sean Corfield</a>. Adopted projects are maintained by many members of the Clojure community, and you could be one of them!</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Please don't hesitate to contact us on the #clj-commons channel on the <a href = "http://clojurians.net">Clojurians</a> slack.</p>


    <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
    <p>In addition to the current goals of maintaining projects, we would also like to be able to contribute in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Improve the experience for beginning Clojure users by providing a clear, coherent, path towards adopting
            Clojure,
        </li>
        <li>Improve the experience of using Clojure for existing users by shaving off its rough edges (error messages,
            stack traces, cryptic docstrings) and providing a unified documentation repository,
        </li>
        <li>Provide a common set of tools and solutions for Clojure users to adopt to reduce duplication of work:
            "Lifting the Lisp curse".
        </li>
    </ul>
