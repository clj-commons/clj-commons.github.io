<h1>clj-commons</h1>

The purpose of clj-commons is to provide a home for retired/done/unmaintained Clojure projects.
Once a project is included in clj-commons, clj-commons will provide basic support for the project,
which includes merging of PR's, upgrading dependencies, and releasing new versions.
